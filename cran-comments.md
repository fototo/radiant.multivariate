## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Updated a link to https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-affero-general-public-license-v3-(agpl-3.0) to fix a libcurl error. I prefer to keep this link in the README.md file because it provides a convenient summary of the terms of the AGPL3 license.
* Added a link to  https://www.r-project.org/Licenses/AGPL-3 in the LICENSE file.
